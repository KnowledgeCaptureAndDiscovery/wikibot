# wikibot

Linked Earth Wiki contains numerous records pertaining to the Earth Science datasets. With several contributors and participation it is a huge repository of paleoclimate data.  Having a clear picture about the concept of Linked Earth and its use case, the wiki bot could be a useful tool to help browsers/contributors in many ways.

-Provide a statistical analysis on the timeline of the contributions.
-List out the dataset in the decreasing/increasing order of the download count.
-Find or suggest intersections in the datasets.
