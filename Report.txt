1. Peachy: PHP framework
This API is fairly new but claims to support a lot more functionalities than the others. 
However, its in the development phase and few libraries aren't released yet. 
It can even support Emails and interface to communicate with the databases. 
The downside is they aren't well documented with the implementation of the API. 
And it requires contacting the developers in case of qualms. 

2. Pywikibot: Python 
Very similar to the java wiki bot except for language specific dependencies. 

3. Java Wiki Bot Framework
This is a Java library with Maven to resolve dependencies. 
Functionalities and implementation of the tool are well documented.  
But it stresses on editing the articles and not drawing statistics based on the articles.

#Jan 12

Discussed Bot functionalities :
1- Metrics bot: top edited resource of the month, week, etc. This could also be used for contributors.
2- contribution Network analysis: see who are the people who tend to work together.
3- news letter bot, summarizing the changes of the last week/ month. To subscribers.
4- in the wiki the underlying model that captures the semantics is an ontology. 
   I want to know if some of the definitions of particular wiki pages change. If they do, I want the bot to notify a certain user.
   More like admin privileges. The changes could be new contributions to the wiki or changes made in the existing data.
5- Analyzes all pages of the wiki and notifies which of them could be duplicates. Super useful!
